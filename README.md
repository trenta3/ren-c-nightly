# Nightly Build for Ren-C
This are unofficial nightly builds of [Ren-C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c).

Builds of Ren-c are automatically uploaded to Amazon S3 each time a build successfully completes.

1. Go to http://hostilefork.com/media/shared/replpad-js/
2. type in the replpad, `latest-of` and that will give you a download link to the same OS as your browser indicates
3. If you want a different OS binary, type eg. `latest-of 0.4.40` 

From a recent OS binary you can do this slightly differently
1. type `latest-of: do @latest-f` and now the function `latest-of` is available to your binary
